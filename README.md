## Introduction

My goal was to build a functioning day planner where you can add and save appointments locally on the page, also that the current date is displayed and the planner is showing tasksm which are overdue. 


## About
I was given starter code which was the style.css file and the index.html. 

I started out by linking the script tags accordingly and the css into the header. First I created div blocks using bootstrap to add in time blocks. I then added in a function to format day and time using day.js. The date can be seen at the top of the planner here. !

I then added in a If/Else statement to allow the past / present or future class to be added. This would then become applicable depending on the time of day. I added another If/Else statement to add and remove appointments on the planner and the ablity to save the appointments was also added in with a 'click' function.
